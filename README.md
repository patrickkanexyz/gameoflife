# Game of Life
A basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

Rules:
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation.
- All dead cells stay dead.

TODO:
- Add generation counter
- Allow pre-populated boards to be loaded as starting boards.
